<p>
I used to manage communications at Are.na, and still help out with advising and strategy. Here are a few of the projects I worked on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://republic.co/arena">crowd investment campaign</a> which raised $270,000 from Are.na members and the public</li>
  <br>
  <li>The biweekly <a href="https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=436d1e848c57bf455254c514e&id=e5f5ff1463">Are.na Dispatch</a> newsletter featuring articles, wisdom, and channels from the community</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/series/are.na/">"How you use the internet mindfully?"</a> – an essay series, book, resource collection, and workshop produced in collaboration with The Creative Independent</li>
</ul>
<br>
I used to work at <a href="http://consortia.net">Consortia</a>, a research-based design and strategy office. Our clients included Audi, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Chicago Architecture Biennial, the Graham Foundation, Louis Vuitton, and the Annenberg Trust. I graduated from Bowdoin College in 2015.
