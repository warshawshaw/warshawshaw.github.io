      Hi, I'm Leo.
   </p>
     <p>
       I currently work on communications, product marketing and partnerships at <a href="https://are.na">Are.na</a>. I've helped Are.na grow its member base and subscription revenue dramatically and I organized a <a href="https://republic.co/arena">crowd investment campaign</a> that raised almost $300,000 by putting equity in the hands of our members.
   </p>
   
   <p>
       Before that I worked on brand and communications strategy at <a href="http://consortia.net">Consortia</a>. While I was there I built a digital content strategy for the <a href="http://www.chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org">Chicago Architecture Biennial</a>, researched trends in retail space for Audi, and helped both the <a href="http://www.grahamfoundation.org">Graham Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu">Harvard Graduate School of Design</a> frame their brands and better articulate their missions.
     </p>
   
     <p>
       Before that I studied history at Bowdoin College.
