      <p class="date">18 Apr 2019</p>
      <p><p>For those of you who live in New York City: do you remember taking the subway before it was blanketed with startup ads? Can you recall the moment when pastels and offer codes started to outnumber for-profit colleges and injury attorneys?</p>

      <p class="date">03 Apr 2019</p>
      <p><p>I was lucky enough to spend a week in Barcelona recently, presenting a workshop called “<a href="https://twitter.com/willak/status/1109157183789379584">How to Use the Internet Mindfully</a>” with Willa Köerner of The Creative Independent at IAM Weekend. Outside of the conference, I spent most of my time walking everywhere and looking around at how the streets work.</p>

      <p class="date">20 Mar 2019</p>
      <p><p><br />
Hudson Yards officially opened last week, and the takes are flying. Michael Kimmelman did an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/14/arts/design/hudson-yards-nyc.html">interactive smackdown</a> for the NYT. The Real Deal <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2019/03/15/hudson-yards-smart-city-or-surveillance-city/">looked into</a> the kiosk surveillance situation (quote from the developer: “We can do with what we want with our data.”) Jeremiah Moss even <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremoss/status/1107056727420219393">snagged a comparison pic</a> of the V<em>**</em>l next to a halal cart shawarma. What a time to be alive.</p>
